Task

Development team gave us the multiple microservices architecture application.

one microservice named vote which is written in python 
one microservice named result which is written in node.js
one microservice named worker which is written in .net

and we have two databases one is in-memory data store and other is database.
we need to implement CI/CD for the above application.

localhost:5000(voting) , localhost:5001(result) ---> we opened these ports in docker-compose.yml

we can deploy vote,result,worker microservices independently thats how microservices will work even if one microservice is disturbed it wont affect others.


Task:

create dockerfile for python(vote),dotnet(worker) and nodejs(result) microservices.

lets take result as an example

package.json , package-lock.json and server.js node.js applications use these.

package.json file is essential in a Node.js project. It holds various metadata relevant to the project and is used to manage the project's dependencies, scripts, version, and other information.

The package-lock.json file is automatically generated when you run npm install.

server.js file is typically the entry point for your Node.js application. It contains the code to set up and start your server.
